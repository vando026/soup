<h1 align="center"> conviva-soup</h1>

A Scala library to estimate totals, means, and ratios from simple random sample or stratified random sample designs. Please see the Demo Page (https://github.com/Conviva-Internal/soup/wiki) for more info. 
 
"For large populations it is the size of the sample taken, not the percentage of the population sampled, that determines the precision of the estimator: If your soup is well stirred, you need to taste only one or two spoonfuls to check the seasoning, whether you have made 1 liter or 20 liters of soup." Sharon Lohr - Sampling Design and Analysis (2022).
